microservice_to_study

Start with Microservices Architecture:

Focus on learning how to build independently deployable services and how services communicate using REST, gRPC, or message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
Learn about API gateways, service discovery, and load balancing.
Dive into basic scaling techniques and how to deploy microservices using containers and orchestration tools like Kubernetes.
Layer in Distributed Systems Concepts:

Gradually start introducing distributed systems topics as they relate to scaling microservices, such as:
Fault tolerance and resilience patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, bulkheads).
Distributed data management: How do microservices share or synchronize data across multiple nodes? Learn about distributed databases (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) and data partitioning.
Consistency models: Understand how distributed systems handle data replication and the trade-offs between strong consistency and eventual consistency.
Concurrency control: Handling operations across distributed systems in a way that maintains data integrity.
