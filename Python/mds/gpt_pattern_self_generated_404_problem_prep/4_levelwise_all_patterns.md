# 4_levelwise_all_patterns

Excellent question — this is exactly the right kind of *architecture-level* thinking 👌
Let’s **cleanly reconcile the numbers** so there’s **no hand-waving**.

---

## 🧠 Final, Clean Pattern Taxonomy (No Overlap)

### 🟢 **Level 1: Core Patterns (25)**

These are the ones we already defined earlier — used in **most interviews**.

Examples:

* Two pointers
* Sliding window
* Binary search
* BFS / DFS
* Basic DP
* Heap / Stack
* Union Find
* Trie / Design / Bit

👉 **Nothing changes here**.

---

## 🟡 **Level 2: Intermediate Patterns (10)**

These **extend core patterns** when constraints grow.

| #  | Pattern                           |
| -- | --------------------------------- |
| 1  | Sweep Line                        |
| 2  | Coordinate Compression            |
| 3  | Two Heaps (Median)                |
| 4  | Offline Queries (Mo’s)            |
| 5  | Fenwick Tree (BIT)                |
| 6  | Segment Tree                      |
| 7  | 0–1 BFS                           |
| 8  | State Graph BFS                   |
| 9  | Top-K with Frequency Buckets      |
| 10 | Difference Array (Advanced usage) |

👉 These are still **interview-relevant**, not CP-only.

---

## 🔴 **Level 3: Advanced Patterns (8)**

These are **rare but high-signal** problems — often asked at **senior / specialist rounds**.

| # | Pattern                       |
| - | ----------------------------- |
| 1 | Dijkstra / Bellman-Ford       |
| 2 | DP Optimization (Knuth / D&C) |
| 3 | Convex Hull Trick             |
| 4 | Interval DP                   |
| 5 | Bitmask DP                    |
| 6 | KMP / Z Algorithm             |
| 7 | Min-Cost Max-Flow             |
| 8 | Heavy Light Decomposition     |

👉 **You do NOT need mastery** of all 8 unless:

* Targeting senior roles
* Doing competitive programming
* Want algorithmic depth

---

## 🔍 Why this separation matters

* **Intermediate** = *“Core failed, extend it”*
* **Advanced** = *“Problem is algorithm-driven, not pattern-driven”*

Most confusion happens when people mix these two.

---

## 🎯 What YOU should focus on (practical advice)

Given your context (product-company interviews, strong fundamentals focus):

### ✅ Mandatory

* Core **25**
* Intermediate **7–8** (Sweep Line, BIT, Segment Tree, Two Heaps, State BFS)

### ⚠️ Optional

* Advanced **pick 3–4 max**

  * Dijkstra
  * Interval DP
  * Bitmask DP
  * KMP (only if string heavy)

## 🧭 Final count (your real prep scope)

| Level                       | Count            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Core                        | 25               |
| Intermediate                | 10               |
| Advanced (selective)        | 4                |
| **Total you actually prep** | **~39 patterns** |
