# each_pattern_6_step

For each pattern, we’ll do:

🔍 When to recognize it

🧠 Mental model (intuition)

🧩 Core template (Python)

⚠️ Common traps

📌 Hand-picked LeetCode problems

🔁 Variations ladder (easy → hard)


---

Perfect ✅ — we’ll **keep the step 2 (intuition) + analogy as the main crux**, and the rest (template, traps, problems, variations) will be **concise**, no bloating.

So our **7-step process** becomes lightweight and interview-focused:

1. 🔍 **When to recognize**
2. 🧠 **Mental model / intuition + analogy** (main focus)
3. 🧩 **Core template (Python, minimal)**
4. ⚠️ **Common traps / gotchas (short bullets)**
5. 📚 **Hand-picked LeetCode problems**
6. 🔁 **Variations ladder (easy → hard)**
7. Optional **tiny illustrative snippet / mini example** only if needed

We can now start pattern by pattern — give me the **first topic** from v2 roadmap.
