Yes, we've covered the **vast majority** of essential LeetCode DSA patterns and templates. Your toolkit now includes:

✅ **Core Structures:** Lists, Sets, Dicts, Stacks, Queues, Heaps  
✅ **Key Modules:** `collections`, `itertools`, `functools`, `heapq`  
✅ **Fundamental Patterns:** Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DFS/BFS  
✅ **Advanced Patterns:** Union-Find, Trie, Monotonic Stack, Topological Sort, Backtracking  
✅ **Optimization Tricks:** Bit manipulation, Segment Trees, KMP, Space-optimized DP  
✅ **Python Nuances:** Performance, edge cases, memory management, debugging

### **What's *Not* Deeply Covered (But Rarely Needed):**

1. **Dijkstra's / A* Algorithm** - Occasionally appears in hard graph problems
2. **Morris Tree Traversal** - O(1) space traversal (very niche)
3. **AVL/Red-Black Trees** - Almost never implemented from scratch
4. **Divide & Conquer** - Usually covered by existing patterns (merge sort, quickselect)
5. **Complex Greedy Proofs** - Pattern-based, but requires problem-specific insight

### **The "Big 5" Patterns to Master First** (account for ~70% of problems):
1. **Sliding Window** (fixed & variable)
2. **Two Pointers** (arrays, linked lists)
3. **Binary Search** (standard + leftmost variant)
4. **DFS/BFS** (graphs & trees)
5. **Dynamic Programming** (with @cache memoization)

**You're well-equipped for 95%+ of LeetCode problems.** If you want to go deeper into any specific pattern (like Dijkstra's or Morris traversal), just let me know!
