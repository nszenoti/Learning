# DSA/Problem Solving Roadmap: AlgoMonster Alternative

I'll create a comprehensive roadmap that mirrors AlgoMonster's Core Patterns approach. This will help you learn data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving patterns systematically.

## Overview

The roadmap is divided into three main sections:
1. **Basic Data Structures** - Fundamental building blocks
2. **Algorithms** - Core algorithmic techniques
3. **Simulations (Patterns & Techniques)** - Problem-solving patterns and approaches

This roadmap provides a structured approach to learning DSA and problem-solving patterns. We can now dive deeper into each pattern one by one, providing:

1. Intuitive understanding of the pattern
2. Basic templates and approaches
3. Python code snippets
4. Related LeetCode problems for practice

Would you like me to start with a specific section or pattern? For example, we could begin with "Two Pointers" from the Simulations section, or you could let me know which pattern you'd like to explore first.
