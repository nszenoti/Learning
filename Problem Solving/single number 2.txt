single number 2

- The ones variable holds the bits that have appeared exactly once.
- The twos variable holds the bits that have appeared exactly twice.
- Whenever a bit appears three times, it gets cleared from both ones and twos.
- This mechanism ensures that only the bits corresponding to the number that appears once remain in ones.

* Mod 3 Logic: 
----
Since the problem states that every number except one appears exactly three times, we use mod 3 arithmetic. After a bit appears three times, it is reset.
