Great question! If you're learning **backend development**, it's essential to have a solid understanding of concepts like **TTL**, **session time**, **caching**, and more — especially if you're aiming for production-level systems or working with APIs, auth, and distributed apps.

Here's a **comprehensive checklist** (with grouped categories) to make sure you cover **essential backend concepts**, including TTL/session-related topics.

## ✅ Backend Learning Checklist (Essentials & Advanced)

### 🔐 1. **Authentication & Authorization**

* [ ] Sessions vs Tokens (JWT)
* [ ] Session Expiry / Timeout
* [ ] Token Expiry & Refresh Tokens
* [ ] Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
* [ ] OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
* [ ] Secure cookie handling (HttpOnly, SameSite)

---

### 🚀 2. **Caching & Performance Optimization**

* [ ] What is Caching and why it matters
* [ ] **TTL (Time to Live)** — cache expiry strategies
* [ ] In-memory caches (Redis, Memcached)
* [ ] ElastiCache (AWS) or other cloud cache services
* [ ] Cache Invalidation Strategies (Write-through, Write-behind, etc.)
* [ ] CDN caching basics

---

### 🧠 3. **State Management (Server-Side)**

* [ ] Stateless vs Stateful APIs
* [ ] Handling user sessions in distributed systems
* [ ] Sticky sessions vs shared session stores (like Redis)

---

### 🌐 4. **HTTP & APIs**

* [ ] HTTP methods, status codes
* [ ] RESTful API design principles
* [ ] Pagination, filtering, sorting
* [ ] Rate Limiting & Throttling
* [ ] API security (HMAC, OAuth, etc.)
* [ ] WebSockets / Long Polling / Server-Sent Events (advanced)

---

### 🧱 5. **Databases**

* [ ] Relational DBs (PostgreSQL, MySQL) — schema, indexes, joins
* [ ] NoSQL DBs (MongoDB, Redis) — when to use what
* [ ] ACID vs BASE
* [ ] Query Optimization & Indexing
* [ ] ORM basics (e.g., Sequelize, Prisma, Hibernate)

---

### ⚙️ 6. **Backend Frameworks (choose one to start)**

* [ ] Node.js + Express / NestJS
* [ ] Django / Flask (Python)
* [ ] Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin)
* [ ] FastAPI (Python)
* [ ] Ruby on Rails

---

### 🌍 7. **Infrastructure & Deployment**

* [ ] Environments (dev, staging, prod)
* [ ] CI/CD basics
* [ ] Containerization (Docker)
* [ ] Load balancers & reverse proxies (Nginx, HAProxy)
* [ ] Horizontal & vertical scaling
* [ ] Using environment variables securely

---

### 📦 8. **Storage & File Handling**

* [ ] File uploads
* [ ] Object storage (AWS S3, etc.)
* [ ] Streaming large files

---

### 📊 9. **Monitoring, Logging & Metrics**

* [ ] Centralized logging (ELK, Loki, etc.)
* [ ] App monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)
* [ ] Alerting (Grafana, PagerDuty)

---

### 📈 10. **Design & Architecture**

* [ ] Clean Architecture / Hexagonal
* [ ] Repository pattern
* [ ] Service layer abstraction
* [ ] Microservices vs Monolith
* [ ] Message queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka)
* [ ] Circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks

---

## 🔁 Bonus: Repetition & Practice

* [ ] Build small projects: blog, todo API, chat app
* [ ] Clone public APIs (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
* [ ] Try load testing tools (e.g., k6, JMeter)
* [ ] Contribute to open source or create your own API
