# roadmap

Absolutely — here's a robust, thoughtfully crafted iOS learning plan tailored **not just for building apps**, but for truly **grokking the platform from an architectural, conceptual, and industry-aligned standpoint**.

---

## 🎯 **High-Level Learning Goals**

* Understand **iOS fundamentals**, architecture, and ecosystem
* Learn **iOS-exclusive topics**, quirks, and best practices
* Focus on **performance**, **security**, **testing**, **app lifecycle**
* Prepare for **real-world development + iOS interviews**
* Keep **UI minimal**, only as needed to learn a concept

---

## 📅 **Structured iOS Grokking Plan** — *Concept-first, Job-ready*

> ✅ Each topic is designed to be a deep-dive for **1 day (or more)**, depending on your pace.
> 🧠 Emphasis on "how it works" > "how to do it".

## 🧠 Tips for Grokking iOS

* Always **draw flowcharts** for concepts like lifecycle, architecture
* Use **Playgrounds** or sample repo for every concept
* Simulate **real-world feature** for practice (offline notes, login, etc.)
* Focus on **debugging, logs, profiling** early — not just UI
* Embrace **source-level reading** (read how UIKit/Foundation really works)
