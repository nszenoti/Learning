# why_stats_in_ols

Excellent and *very insightful* question.

You're absolutely right:

> **OLS is an algebraic method** — it **minimizes the sum of squared errors** to find the best-fit line.
> So **why bring in statistics at all?**

Let's break it down.

## ✅ OLS is Fundamentally Algebraic

OLS solves:

$$
\min_\beta \; \| y - X\beta \|^2
$$

This is **pure linear algebra**:

* You set the derivative of the loss function to zero,
* Solve the normal equations:

  $$
  X^TX\beta = X^Ty
  $$
* Or:

  $$
  \hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
  $$

No probability or distribution assumptions required **just to compute the coefficients**.

## 🧠 Then Why Bring in Statistics?

Because real-world data is **random**, **noisy**, and **sampled**. That means:

> OLS is used on **data that comes from some unknown generative process** — and we want to **reason about that process**.

This is where **statistics** comes in.

### 🔁 We Go From:

1. **Algebra**: “What line best fits *these points*?”
2. **Statistics**: “What can I infer about the *population* that generated these points?”

## 📊 Why Add Distributional Assumptions?

When you assume the error terms $\varepsilon$ are:

* **Independent**
* **Identically distributed**
* **Normal with mean 0 and constant variance**

Then you can:

* **Make inferences** about the true parameters $\beta$
* Build **confidence intervals** and **hypothesis tests**
* Understand **how reliable your model is**

Without those assumptions, you're just fitting a curve — but you can't **trust any conclusions about the data-generating process**.

## 🤖 Analogy with Machine Learning

Think of it like this:

| Perspective       | Goal                                   | Needs Distribution? |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| ML (Algebraic)    | Minimize prediction error              | ❌ No                |
| Stats (Inference) | Make confident claims about parameters | ✅ Yes               |

## ✅ TL;DR

| Aspect                       | Algebraic OLS           | Statistical OLS                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Main concern                 | Best fit line           | Inference about population relationships |
| Needs normality of residuals | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes (for inference)                    |
| Uses probability             | ❌ No                    | ✅ Yes                                    |
| Example                      | Predict price from size | Test if size has a *significant* effect  |

## Final Thought

> **OLS is like a ruler — it gives you the best line.
> Statistics tells you how much you should trust that line.**

Would you like a side-by-side comparison of **OLS as used in ML vs Stats** in tabular or code form?
