✅ Yes, you're absolutely right:

> **OLS gives you $\hat\beta$** — the estimated coefficients from the data.

But here's the key distinction:

---

## 🎯 OLS gives you:

$$
\hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$

This is the **best-fitting β for your current dataset** — based on minimizing squared error.

---

## 📈 Statistical inference asks:

> “How close is $\hat\beta$ to the true (unknown) $\beta$ of the data-generating process?”

We only see **one sample**, but we imagine:

* There’s a **true underlying β**
* Our $\hat\beta$ is just **one estimate**, affected by noise

### ⚖️ So:

| Concept          | Meaning                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $\hat\beta$      | Estimated coefficient from OLS                                                                       |
| $\beta$ (true β) | Unknown true parameter (in population)                                                               |
| **Inference**    | Using stats to assess how close $\hat\beta$ is to $\beta$ — via confidence intervals, p-values, etc. |

---

### ✅ Final short answer:

> Yes, **OLS finds $\hat\beta$** — but **inference** is about using that $\hat\beta$ to say something about the **true unknown β** behind the scenes.
