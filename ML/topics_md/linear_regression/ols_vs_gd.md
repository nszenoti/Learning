You're absolutely on point to ask this — and it's a common conceptual mix-up in learning both **OLS** and **Gradient Descent**.

Let’s cleanly differentiate:

## 🔍 You're Asking:

> If we take the derivative of the loss and set it to 0 to solve OLS, **isn’t that gradient descent**?

---

## ✅ Short Answer:

**No**, setting the derivative to 0 and solving it analytically is **not gradient descent**.
It's a **closed-form solution**.
Gradient Descent is a **numerical optimization technique**.

### 📌 Let’s Break It Down

### 🎯 OLS (Closed-form solution)

OLS minimizes the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** loss:

$$
J(\beta) = \frac{1}{n} \| y - X\beta \|^2
$$

You compute the **gradient**, set it to **0**, and solve:

$$
\nabla_\beta J(\beta) = -2X^T(y - X\beta) = 0
\Rightarrow X^TX\beta = X^Ty
\Rightarrow \hat\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty
$$

✅ This is an **algebraic (analytic)** solution — not iterative.

### ⚙️ Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent also tries to minimize the same loss:

$$
J(\beta) = \frac{1}{n} \| y - X\beta \|^2
$$

But instead of solving it directly, it **iteratively updates** the weights:

$$
\beta_{t+1} = \beta_t - \eta \cdot \nabla_\beta J(\beta_t)
$$

Where:

* $\eta$ is the learning rate,
* $\nabla_\beta J(\beta_t) = -2X^T(y - X\beta_t)$

✅ This is a **numerical method**, used especially when:

* $X^TX$ is too big to invert,
* Or the loss is non-convex or not analytically solvable (e.g., deep nets).

## 🔁 Key Differences

| Aspect              | OLS Closed Form       | Gradient Descent                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Solves              | Analytically (once)   | Iteratively (many steps)             |
| Requires Inversion? | Yes: $(X^TX)^{-1}$    | No                                   |
| Speed               | Fast for small data   | Better for large or high-dimensional |
| Use Case            | Linear regression     | Deep learning, logistic regression   |
| Precision           | Exact (theoretically) | Approximate (converges gradually)    |

## 🧠 So your insight is accurate:

> **Taking a derivative of loss and setting to zero** is the classic approach of **solving optimization analytically** (OLS).
>
> **Gradient descent** uses the derivative too — but doesn’t solve it. It just **uses the slope direction** to slowly reach the minimum.
