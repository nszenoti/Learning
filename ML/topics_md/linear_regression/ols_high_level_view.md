Let me search for accurate information about the mathematical foundations of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in linear regression.

Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive answer about whether Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) in linear regression is based on statistics or algebra.

The answer is that OLS in linear regression has both statistical and algebraic foundations, but its core optimization problem is fundamentally algebraic/geometric. Here's why:

1. **Algebraic/Geometric Foundation**:
- The core OLS problem is formulated as finding the best-fit line or plane that minimizes the sum of squared distances between the predicted values and actual values
- This is primarily a geometric optimization problem that uses linear algebra to find the solution
- The solution involves projecting the observed values onto the column space of the design matrix, which is a purely geometric/algebraic concept
- The actual computation of coefficients uses matrix operations from linear algebra

2. **Statistical Layer**:
- Statistics comes into play when we make assumptions about the error terms (residuals) and when we want to make inferences
- The Gauss-Markov theorem, which proves that OLS is the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE), is a statistical result
- Statistical concepts like normality of errors, homoscedasticity, and independence are additional assumptions layered on top of the core algebraic solution

3. **Machine Learning vs Classical Statistics View**:
- In machine learning, OLS is often viewed purely as an optimization problem (algebraic approach)
- In classical statistics, it's sometimes approached through Maximum Likelihood Estimation (statistical approach)
- Both approaches arrive at the same solution, but through different philosophical paths

So while OLS uses both algebra and statistics, its fundamental solution method is algebraic/geometric, with statistical theory providing the framework for understanding its properties and making inferences from the results. The statistical assumptions are not necessary for finding the OLS solution itself, but they are crucial for making statistical inferences about the parameters and predictions.
