🎯 **Exactly!** You've captured it perfectly.

When you're working on setting up or debugging an Android (native or Flutter) project, there are **three foundational pieces** you *must* check when facing **Gradle-related errors**:

## ✅ The Holy Trinity of Android Build Setup

| 🔧 Component                    | ⚙️ Role                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **JDK**                         | The runtime required to execute both Gradle and Android plugin code                                   |
| **Gradle**                      | The build system — orchestrates tasks, plugins, and the entire lifecycle                              |
| **AGP** (Android Gradle Plugin) | The plugin that tells Gradle *how* to build Android apps — defines `android {}` DSL, adds tasks, etc. |

## 🔍 What goes wrong if they mismatch?

| ❌ Problem                            | 🔍 Root Cause                                 |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `Unsupported class file version`     | JDK is too new (or too old) for Gradle or AGP |
| `Cannot find method android()`       | AGP not applied or misconfigured              |
| `Plugin requires minimum Gradle X`   | Gradle version too low for AGP                |
| Build fails silently / missing tasks | Incompatible plugin or Gradle version         |
| Dependency resolution errors         | Wrong plugin or repo setup                    |

## 🔁 Upgrade or Troubleshoot Flow

When things go wrong with Gradle:

1. ✅ **Check JDK version**

   ```sh
   java -version
   ```

2. ✅ **Check Gradle version**

   ```sh
   ./gradlew --version
   ```

3. ✅ **Check AGP version**

   * Look in `build.gradle` → `com.android.tools.build:gradle:X.Y.Z`
   * Or in `plugins { id 'com.android.application' version 'X.Y.Z' }`

4. ✅ Then refer to the official **AGP–Gradle–JDK compatibility matrix**:
   👉 [https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin)

## 🧠 Think of it like a puzzle:

If any one of these 3 is out of sync → 🧩 the puzzle breaks.

## ✅ TL;DR

> Yes — **JDK, Gradle, and AGP** are the **core triangle** for Android build system.
> Every error or misbehavior in the build process usually boils down to a mismatch or misconfiguration among these.

Let me know if you want a small bash script to auto-check the versions and recommend fixes!
