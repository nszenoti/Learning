# agp_vs_gradle

Exactly! You're thinking in the right direction now — let's clarify both parts of your question step by step:

---

## 🧩 1. **Why Android Studio updates come with Gradle/AGP changes**

Yes — **every Android Studio release tightly couples with specific Gradle and AGP versions**.

### Why?

Because:

* **AGP (Android Gradle Plugin)** is developed by Google as part of the Android tools.
* **Gradle** is an independent build tool, not Android-specific.
* AGP is a **plugin for Gradle** → it *runs on top of Gradle*.

But:

* Newer AGP versions require **newer Gradle versions**.
* New Gradle versions may break old AGP versions (APIs removed, changed behavior).
* Android Studio updates its **wizards and integrations** (like Compose preview, layouts, etc.) to depend on specific AGP features.

> ✅ So to avoid incompatibilities, Android Studio **recommends or enforces** compatible Gradle + AGP combos.

---

## 🔧 2. **Why AGP and Gradle are separate versions**

### TL;DR:

Because **Gradle is generic**, but **AGP is Android-specific.**

---

### ⚙️ Gradle

* Developed by Gradle Inc.
* Works with **any language** (Java, Kotlin, C++, Scala, etc.)
* Used outside Android too (Spring, Micronaut, etc.)
* Version: `6.8`, `7.4`, `8.0` etc.

### 📱 Android Gradle Plugin (AGP)

* Developed by **Google**
* **Adds Android build logic** to Gradle

  * How to build `.apk`, `.aab`
  * Resource merging
  * AndroidManifest parsing
  * Flavor/buildType handling
* Version: `4.2.2`, `7.4.2`, `8.0.2`, etc.

> 🔁 AGP **uses** Gradle as its engine, but adds all Android-specific rules.

### 📊 Version Compatibility Example

| Android Studio          | AGP Version | Gradle Version |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 2020.3.1 (Arctic Fox)   | 7.0.0       | 7.0+           |
| 2022.2.1 (Electric Eel) | 7.4.0       | 7.5+           |
| 2023.1.1 (Hedgehog)     | 8.0.2       | 8.0+           |

> ❗ If you mismatch:
>
> * Android Studio may warn or break preview
> * Gradle build will fail with version errors
> * AGP might throw errors like: `This project requires AGP X.Y.Z but is using Gradle Z.Z`

## 🧪 How to Check or Set Versions

### 📁 `android/build.gradle` (project-level)

```gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.0.2'  // <-- AGP version
    }
}
```

### 📁 `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.2-all.zip  // <-- Gradle version
```

## ✅ Summary

| Term               | Who Maintains | Purpose                        | Scope           | Versioning                |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Gradle**         | Gradle Inc.   | General-purpose build system   | All Java/Kotlin | 6.x, 7.x, 8.x             |
| **AGP**            | Google        | Android-specific Gradle plugin | Android only    | 4.x – 8.x                 |
| **Android Studio** | Google        | IDE that uses Gradle + AGP     | Android only    | Arctic Fox, Giraffe, etc. |

Let me know if you'd like:

* A visual map of version compatibility
* A CLI-only native Android build setup
* A sample `gradle-wrapper.properties` and `build.gradle` for a modern project

Would you like me to show how to safely upgrade Gradle/AGP in a native project too?
