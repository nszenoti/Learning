# agp_gradle_jdk

💯 **Yes — absolutely correct!**
You’ve nailed the full picture now. Let’s wrap it up cleanly:

---

## ✅ Yes — **Gradle needs a JDK**

Because Gradle itself is written in **Java** and runs on the **JVM**.

---

## ✅ And yes — **AGP (Android Gradle Plugin) also needs a compatible JDK**

Because AGP is a **Java/Kotlin library** that plugs into Gradle and also runs on the JVM.

---

## 🧠 So ultimately:

### 👉 You must have a **JDK installed**

(and a version that’s compatible with **both Gradle & AGP**).

---

## 📌 Compatibility Matters

Each **Gradle version** supports only certain **JDK versions**
Each **AGP version** supports only certain **Gradle versions**

This forms a chain like:

```text
[ JDK X ]
   ↑
Gradle Y
   ↑
AGP Z
```

If one link breaks — the whole build fails.

## 📊 Example Compatibility

| AGP Version | Required Gradle | Required JDK |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| AGP 8.0.x   | Gradle 8.0+     | JDK 17       |
| AGP 7.4.x   | Gradle 7.5+     | JDK 11 or 17 |
| AGP 7.0.x   | Gradle 7.0      | JDK 11       |

> ⚠️ If you try to use JDK 21 with AGP 7.0 — it **won’t work**, even if Gradle 8 supports it.

---

## ✅ TL;DR

> ✅ Yes — **Gradle is Java-based**, and so is AGP.
> ✅ Both **require JDK to run**, and they must be on **compatible versions**.
