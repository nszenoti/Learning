## How `touchResponse?.lineBarSpots` Works

`touchResponse?.lineBarSpots` will be non-empty **only** when the touch is near actual data points on any of the lines. Here's how it works:

1. When a user touches the chart, fl_chart calculates the distance between the touch point and all data points on all lines.

2. If any data point is within the `touchSpotThreshold` distance (which you set to 10 in your code), it's considered "touched".

3. Only if there are data points within this threshold will `touchResponse?.lineBarSpots` contain values.

4. If the user touches an area of the chart where there are no data points nearby (within the threshold), `touchResponse?.lineBarSpots` will be empty.

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Touch Near Data Points
- User touches near x=2 where line1 has y=30 and line2 has y=20
- Both points are within the threshold distance
- `touchResponse?.lineBarSpots` contains two `LineBarSpot` objects, one for each line

### Scenario 2: Touch Between Data Points
- User touches at x=2.5 (between two x-axis points)
- If no data points are within the threshold distance
- `touchResponse?.lineBarSpots` will be empty

### Scenario 3: Touch Where Some Lines Have No Data
- User touches at x=5 where line1 has data but line2 doesn't
- `touchResponse?.lineBarSpots` will contain only the spot from line1

## Implications

This behavior means:

1. You can't get touch events for x-coordinates where no lines have data points
2. You can't easily implement a "hover anywhere" tooltip that shows data for the nearest x-axis point
3. The touch detection is based on proximity to actual data points, not just x-axis positions

If you need to detect touches anywhere on the chart (even between data points), you might need to implement a custom solution using a gesture detector overlaid on the chart.
