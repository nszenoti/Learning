Exactly right. You've understood the core limitation perfectly:

1. In fl_chart's BarChart, the X-axis positions are always sequential indices (0, 1, 2, ...) corresponding to the positions in your data list.

2. You cannot skip actual data points or indices on the X-axis - every bar group will be positioned at these sequential indices.

3. What you can control is which labels are displayed for these indices through the `getTitlesWidget` callback.

This is why your current approach with the modulo check (`index % labelInterval == 0`) is the correct way to handle label density. The chart will still render all data points at positions 0, 1, 2, etc., but you're selectively showing labels only at certain intervals.

If you needed true binning or non-sequential X positions, you would need to:
1. Pre-process your data to combine or aggregate values into bins
2. Only pass these aggregated data points to the chart
3. Provide appropriate labels for these aggregated points

But within fl_chart's BarChart itself, the X positions will always follow the sequential index pattern, and you can only control the visual display of labels, not the actual positioning of the bars.
