Instance 1: Standalone Flutter Has Priority
If the standalone Flutter is installed (e.g., at ~/flutter/bin) and is before fvm in the PATH, the system will use the standalone Flutter version for all flutter commands.
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/flutter/bin:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin:$PATH"
```
```bash
flutter --version
# Output: Flutter 3.10.0 (Standalone Flutter)

fvm flutter --version
# Output: Flutter 3.13.0 (FVM global version, if set)
```
