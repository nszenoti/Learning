doubts


Does namedRoutes (ie MaterialApp.routes) follows page-backed route ?

Does GetX -> GetPage is the Page thats passed to `Navigator.pages` 
Does GetX -> GetPage uses declarative mechanism (ie create page-backed route)


BLOC/Cubit
- What is purpose of `listen:false` param in BlocProvider.of(context)
  as 
  BLOC doesnt implement ChangeNotifier (ie hence its not a Listenable Notifier)
  |
  Instead state of bloc is listenable but not Bloc object itself

- Is there any other way to notify the clients apart from notifyListeners() (of ChangeNotifier)


* ListView & Modal :
  ----
  If tile is Row() or Align()
  i.e last tile -> Row() & rest Align()

  each child of either Row/Align uses Modal

  In such case as soon as new element is added
  -> Modal is breaking despite new element is created !!
