Great questions about state management with overlays! Let's address both of your concerns:

## Regarding State Management with Overlays

When using `OverlayPortal` or any overlay mechanism, there are some important considerations:

1. **Does setState in parent rebuild the overlay?**
   Yes, when you call `setState()` in the parent widget that contains the `OverlayPortal`, the overlay child will be rebuilt if the `OverlayPortal` is showing. This is because the overlay child is still part of the widget tree of the parent, even though it's rendered in a different location visually.

2. **Tracking selected items:**
   You have two options:

   a) **Parent-managed state (recommended)**: The parent widget maintains the list of selected items and passes it to `PopupMenu`. When an item is selected, the parent updates its state, which rebuilds the overlay with the updated selection.
   
   b) **Internal state**: The `PopupMenu` could maintain its own state, but this would make it harder to access the final selection when the overlay is closed.

## Implementation Recommendation

For multi-select with overlays, I recommend:

```language:lib/hyper_connect/app/pages/widgets/popup/popup_menu.dart
// ... existing code ...

  Widget _buildItem(int i) {
    final item = items[i];
    final isItemSelected = isMultiSelect 
        ? selectedItems.contains(item)
        : selected == item;
    
    return Material(
      child: InkWell(
        overlayColor: WidgetStateProperty.all(ColorName.popupMenuItmHover),
        onTap: () => onSelect(item),
        child: Padding(
          padding: itemPadding ?? EdgeInsets.zero,
          child: Row(
            children: [
              if (isMultiSelect) 
                Padding(
                  padding: const EdgeInsets.only(left: 8, right: 8),
                  child: Checkbox(
                    value: isItemSelected,
                    onChanged: (_) => onSelect(item),
                    materialTapTargetSize: MaterialTapTargetSize.shrinkWrap,
                  ),
                ),
              Expanded(child: itemBuilder(i, item)),
              if (!isMultiSelect && isItemSelected)
                const Icon(Icons.check, color: ColorName.primary, size: 18),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

// ... existing code ...
```

And in your parent widget:

```dart
// In parent widget
Set<YourItemType> _selectedItems = {};

void _handleItemSelect(YourItemType item) {
  setState(() {
    if (_isMultiSelect) {
      // Toggle selection
      if (_selectedItems.contains(item)) {
        _selectedItems.remove(item);
      } else {
        _selectedItems.add(item);
      }
    } else {
      // Single select - close overlay and use the item
      _closeOverlay();
      _useSingleSelectedItem(item);
    }
  });
}

// In build method
OverlayPortal(
  controller: _overlayController,
  overlayChildBuilder: (context) {
    return PopupMenu<YourItemType>(
      // ... other properties
      isMultiSelect: _isMultiSelect,
      selectedItems: _selectedItems,
      onSelect: _handleItemSelect,
    );
  },
  child: YourTriggerWidget(),
)
```

This approach ensures:
1. The parent manages the selection state
2. The overlay rebuilds when the selection changes
3. You have access to the selected items when the overlay is closed
4. The UI updates correctly in both single and multi-select modes

The `setState()` in the parent will cause the overlay to rebuild with the updated selection, so you don't need to worry about tracking state in the `PopupMenu` widget itself.
