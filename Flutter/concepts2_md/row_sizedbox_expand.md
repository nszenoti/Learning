`SizedBox.expand()` will actually force the Row to take up all available height (and width) in the parent container. It overrides the Row's natural sizing behavior.

Here's what happens:

```dart
Container(
  height: 300,
  width: 300,
  color: Colors.yellow,
  child: SizedBox.expand(
    child: ColoredBox(
      color: Colors.red,
      child: Row(
        children: [
          Text('Selected Value'),
          SizedBox(width: 16),
          Icon(Icons.arrow_drop_down)
        ],
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

In this example:

1. The `SizedBox.expand()` forces its child (the ColoredBox) to fill the entire 300x300 Container
2. The ColoredBox fills that entire space with red color
3. The Row is still laid out according to its normal rules within that space
4. The Row's children are positioned based on the Row's properties (like crossAxisAlignment)

If you want the Row itself to expand vertically and have its children fill the height:

```dart
Container(
  height: 300,
  width: 300,
  color: Colors.yellow,
  child: SizedBox.expand(
    child: ColoredBox(
      color: Colors.red,
      child: Row(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch, // This makes children stretch vertically
        children: [
          Expanded(child: Center(child: Text('Selected Value'))),
          SizedBox(width: 16),
          Center(child: Icon(Icons.arrow_drop_down))
        ],
      ),
    ),
  ),
)
```

The key difference between:
- `SizedBox.expand()` forces its child to take all available space
- The Row by itself will only be as tall as its tallest child, even inside a SizedBox.expand
- To make the Row's children fill the height, you need to use `crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.stretch` and ensure the children can expand (using widgets like Expanded, Flexible, or containers with constraints)

So `SizedBox.expand()` does make its direct child take all available space, but you need additional configuration to make the Row's children fill that space vertically.
