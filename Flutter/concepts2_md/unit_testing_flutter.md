Yes, exactly! Let me explain the standard test philosophy and steps:

1. **Directory Structure**
   - Mirror your `lib` structure in `test` directory
   - Example:
     ```
     lib/
       └── feature/
           └── utils/
               └── my_util.dart
     test/
       └── feature/
           └── utils/
               └── my_util_test.dart
     ```

2. **File Naming Convention**
   - Test files should end with `_test.dart`
   - Name should match the file being tested
   - Example: `voice_call_utils.dart` → `voice_call_utils_test.dart`

3. **Test Organization**
   - Group related tests together
   - Test one feature/function at a time
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Clear test descriptions that explain the behavior

4. **What Test Framework Provides**
   - `test` function to define individual tests
   - `group` function to organize related tests
   - Rich assertion functions (`expect`, `equals`, etc.)
   - Better error reporting
   - Test runners and filters
   - Coverage reporting

5. **Best Practices**
   - Test both success and failure cases
   - Test edge cases
   - Keep tests independent
   - Don't test implementation details
   - One assertion per test (when possible)
   - Clear, descriptive test names

6. **Moving from Basic to Framework**
   - Our current tests using `assert` would become:
     ```dart
     test('should return false when centerPhoneCode is null', () {
       expect(VoiceCallUtils.canMakeCall(
         centerPhoneCode: null,
         guestPhoneNumber: '+919876543210',
       ), isFalse);
     });
     ```

7. **What Stays the Same**
   - Directory structure
   - File naming
   - Test cases and logic
   - What you're testing
   - Test organization principles

8. **What Changes with Framework**
   - Syntax for writing tests
   - Better error messages
   - More assertion options
   - Test running capabilities
   - Coverage reporting

So the test dependency is mainly about:
- Better organization (`group`/`test`)
- Better assertions (`expect`)
- Better reporting
- Test running features

But the core principles of what and how you test remain the same!

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points?
