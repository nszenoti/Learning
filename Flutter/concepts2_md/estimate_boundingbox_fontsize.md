# Formula to Estimate Text Dimensions Based on Font Size

## Height Formula
For estimating text height based on font size:

```
Height ≈ fontSize × lineHeightMultiplier
```

Where:
- `lineHeightMultiplier` is typically:
  - ~1.2 for default text (no height specified)
  - Can range from 1.0 to 1.5+ depending on font and design requirements

## Width Formula
For estimating text width based on font size:

```
Width ≈ fontSize × averageCharacterWidthRatio × numberOfCharacters
```

Where:
- `averageCharacterWidthRatio` is typically:
  - ~0.6 for narrow characters (i, l, t, etc.)
  - ~0.8 for average characters
  - ~1.0 for wide characters (m, w, etc.)
  - ~0.65 for a mixed-character English text

## Practical Examples

For a 14-16 character string:

### Font Size 20:
- Height: 20 × 1.2 ≈ 24 pixels
- Width: 20 × 0.65 × 15 ≈ 195 pixels

### Font Size 16:
- Height: 16 × 1.2 ≈ 19 pixels
- Width: 16 × 0.65 × 15 ≈ 156 pixels

These are approximations and may need adjustment based on:
- Specific font family
- Font weight (bold text is wider)
- Character distribution
- Text direction and language

For precise measurements, use Flutter's `TextPainter` to calculate exact dimensions for specific text.
