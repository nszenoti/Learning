infinite scroll pagination

Issue Found 

Widget - > PagedListView.seperated() // with shrinkWrap = false
|
 FirstPageProgress Indicator 
 - If it's a ListView (of any kind)
    |
    then the UI will break saying 
    "RenderViewport does not support returning intrinsic dimensions.
Calculating the intrinsic dimensions would require instantiating every child of the viewport, which defeats the point of viewports being lazy."

     It's because SliverFillRemaining -> uses false for hasScrollBody & 
                    |
                    our first page indicator widget is passed to it as a child
                    Hence our widget is scrollable (ie ListView)
                    But
                    Package assumes it to be non-scrollable

Solution

Let user decides if it's first-page progress indicator is scrollable or not via a boolean flag
taken with PagedListView.seperated()
