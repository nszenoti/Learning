Yes, exactly! With Dio you can send bytes in two ways:

1. **Direct Bytes** (simpler approach):
```dart
// Sending Uint8List directly
await dio.post(
  path,
  data: bytes,  // Uint8List or List<int>
  options: Options(
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'},
  ),
);
```

2. **As Stream** (for larger files or when you need more control):
```dart
// Sending as Stream
await dio.post(
  path,
  data: Stream.fromIterable(bytes.map((e) => [e])),
  options: Options(
    headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'},
  ),
);
```

Choose based on your needs:
- **Direct**: Good for smaller files, simpler code
- **Stream**: Better for large files, memory efficiency, or when you need to control the flow

Both approaches will work for sending binary data to the server. The main difference is how the data is buffered and sent.
