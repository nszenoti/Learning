* Pages vs Routes | Flutter
----
In Flutter, pages are just widgets that we assign to routes. And routes are managed by the Navigator, which is (you guessed it) just a widget! 
A Navigator widget is an abstraction over a widget that lays its children out in a stack nature.

* ListView :
  ---
  -> Items are building with limited constraints of height in mind  (ie Even if you Have Unconstrained Column as your item) It wont go as long as it should
  because Listview will consume rest space as expanded & give the height as much needed for your item


* setState, ListView & Widgets & conditional widgets :
  ---
  Avoid using conditional widgets as much as possible because it will enforce widget rebuild
  & lead to more work
  Eg

  if(enable)
  {
    return AbsorbPointer(absorbing: true, child: Opacity(opacity: 0.5, child: childWidget))
  }else{
    return childWidget
  }

  vs

  return AbsorbPointer(
    absorbing: disable, 
    child: Opacity(opacity: disable ? 0.5 : 1, child: childWidget)
  )


  Whenever we toggle between enable/disable, First one will do more work as its removing entire 2 widgets from tree and rebuilding all the widgets down it

  Whereas in second case None of the widgets is removed from treee hence only updates gets 
  passed on resulting in less work (ie not creating all the widgets down in hierarchy from scratch)

* TextFormField & Focus :
  ---
  Initially textform field doesnt has focus
  If focused textformfield loose focus somehow due to recreate widget then that focus is passed to sibbling textformfield, whosoever catches that focus event
