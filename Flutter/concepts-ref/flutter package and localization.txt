flutter:
  generate: true
  l10n:
    arb-dir: lib/l10n
    template-arb-file: app_en.arb
    output-localization-file: l10n.dart
    output-class: AppLocalizations
    synthetic-package: false   # If false, generated files will be placed in lib
    output-dir: lib/generated  # Specify output dir when synthetic-package is false


When to Use synthetic-package: false
If you are developing a Flutter package or you want more control and visibility over the localization files, setting synthetic-package: false and using output-dir: lib/generated is useful. This makes sure that the generated files are part of your project's lib folder, which is important in package development since only the lib folder is exposed to the package consumers.
