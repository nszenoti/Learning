Useful commands

flutter pub outdated // see outdated versions

------

Commands to run

1) check outdated dependenies > 
   - dart pub outdated --mode=null-safety  // see outdated packages
   - dart pub upgrade --null-safety  // migrate packages (automatically)
     [NOTE: you can manually also migrate them]


--- All dependencies are now being pointed to migrated (now its turn for your project migration)

2) we need to set the SDK constraint to a pre-null-safety version.
   
   environment:
  sdk: ">=2.11.0 <3.0.0"  # Set to pre-null-safety version


2) 
    dart pub get   // get all dependencies for migration tool
try run flutter pub get

  
3) Project Migration
