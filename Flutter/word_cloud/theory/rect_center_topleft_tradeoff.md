earlier in spiral we use to calc
Rect paddedRect = Offset(dx, dy) & paddedSize;
vs now Rect.fromCenter() what;s difference between both





Great question! These are two different ways to create a `Rect` in Flutter, with an important difference:

1. `Offset(dx, dy) & paddedSize`:
   - Creates a rectangle with its **top-left corner** at the specified offset
   - The `&` operator combines an offset (top-left point) with a size

2. `Rect.fromCenter(center: position, width: w, height: h)`:
   - Creates a rectangle with its **center** at the specified position
   - The rectangle extends width/2 in each horizontal direction and height/2 in each vertical direction from the center

The key difference is the reference point:
- In the spiral approach, you were working with top-left coordinates
- In this new approach, we're working with center coordinates

Using center coordinates is more intuitive for this algorithm because:
1. We want words to be centered around their placement points
2. It's easier to calculate distances between centers of words
3. When considering rotations, rotating around the center is more natural

This is why we need to convert back to top-left coordinates at the end, since Flutter's Stack widget positions based on top-left.
