## Core folder and App folder

`core/` is for **global, dependency-free** utilities. Routes:
- Are **app-specific orchestration** (tightly coupled to features)
- Create **dependency on features** (which should never import from core)
- Belong with app-level config (`app.dart`, DI setup)

`app/` = "how the app is wired together"  
`core/` = "foundational tools anything can use"
