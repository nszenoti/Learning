Large Screen Apps

notes1

To update diff parts of an app from different component of same screen
You have multiple options :

1) Create and maintain streams for this purpose  // for `builder` purpose

2) Create Custom Stream Class (ie DartNotificationCenter) 
   // here you can keep track of channel - observers, 
      with option of subscribe, unsubscribe, post (data to channel)

      For Subscribe unsubscribe you need to maintain a Map<Channel, List[Observers]>


* DartNotificationCenter  // Central Notification Center for your App
   |
   This way you can communicate from any part of app to any part of an App
    (without having any Streams)
