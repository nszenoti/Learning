1. When a Bloc State can have multiple conflicitng attributes 
   It's better to create a seperate class and let's state use composition principle

   For example

   State can have 

   Fetch
   Save
   Delete

   for this status can be overlapping for eg loading, progress, done, ...

   Better to Create seperate class for each and let state be composed of those classes

   Eg

   State(
   	FetchStatus,
   	SaveStatus, 
   	DeleteStatus, 
   	Data,
   	Error
   )
