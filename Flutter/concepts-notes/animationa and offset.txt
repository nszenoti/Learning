animationa and offset

In Flutter, the Offset values in an animation like SlideTransition are relative to the widget's size, where 1.0 represents 100% of the widget's width or height.


Hereâ€™s how it works:

Offset(0.0, -1.0): The widget is offset by -1 times its own height, or one full height above its normal position.
Offset(0.0, 1.0): The widget would be offset by 1 times its height, or one full height below its normal position.
Offset(0.0, 0.0): The widget is positioned exactly at its normal position.


Why -1 Represents One Full Height

The SlideTransition interprets the offset values as percentages of the widget's size. For the Y-axis:

Offset(0.0, -1.0) means 100% of the widget's height in the upward (negative Y) direction.

This allows the widget to animate smoothly from a position just outside the visible area above, moving down to Offset(0.0, 0.0) (its intended position).

So, -1.0 for the Y-axis means the widget starts one entire height above, creating the sliding-down effect as it animates into place.
