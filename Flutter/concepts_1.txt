* Pageless vs Page Route :
  ---
  ref : https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Navigator/pages.html

  
  Whenever you define/register the Page in `Navigator.pages`, then route corresp to that page
  in navigator stack is called as a Page-Based Route

  Whenever you `push` directly on Navigator object, then such routes lying on Navigatot Stack 
  are called as Page-less Route

  NOTE:
  -> Page (defined in `Navigator.pages`) gets converted into Route as Navigator works with Route 
  (Analogous to how widget gets converted to element)
