Perfect! You’re spot-on — **Refactoring Guru** and **SourceMaking** are both excellent for **learning design patterns and refactoring** in a visual, intuitive way. If you're looking for something in that **style** — well-structured, incremental, visual and with code examples — I can help curate a **customized roadmap** and also help explain each concept like a personal "Refactoring Guru tutor."

## 🛠️ Want to Begin?

Let’s start with a **design pattern or principle**, and I’ll teach it to you just like Refactoring Guru:

* With a metaphor / analogy
* Visual representation (UML if needed)
* Code example (before/after if refactoring)
* When to use, and when **not** to use

Choose:

* A **Design Pattern**: e.g. Factory, Decorator, Strategy?
* Or a **Principle**: e.g. SRP, Open/Closed, Clean Code, Composition?

I'll grok it for you step-by-step. Just say the word 🙂
