Yes — with **Be A Better Dev**, that’s the perfect starting flow.

Here’s the **right sequence** if your aim is to *understand intuitively* and then go hands-on:

---

## **Step 1 — Cloud Fundamentals First**

📍 Watch his video section (or dedicated videos) on:

* What cloud computing is
* IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, FaaS
* Regions & availability zones
* Shared responsibility model
* Basic networking (VPC, subnets, security groups — just the concepts)

💡 *Reason*: Once you grasp these, AWS won’t feel like a giant random service list — you’ll know where each service fits.

---

## **Step 2 — AWS Core Building Blocks**

After fundamentals, move to AWS basics from his video:

* IAM (permissions)
* S3 (object storage)
* EC2 (servers)
* DynamoDB or RDS (databases)
* CloudWatch (monitoring)
* Lambda (serverless compute)
* API Gateway (API entry point)

💡 *Reason*: This is your **toolbox** — later serverless projects will combine these.

---

## **Step 3 — Serverless Patterns**

Once you know core services, learn how they’re glued together in serverless:

* Event-driven model
* API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB
* S3 triggers Lambda
* Scheduled Lambda (cron jobs)

---

## **Step 4 — Hands-On Mini Projects**

From Be A Better Dev’s recommendations or AWS docs:

1. “Hello World” Lambda via API Gateway
2. File upload to S3 → Lambda processing → store in DynamoDB
3. Scheduled job with Lambda

---

If you follow **this order** —
**Cloud basics → AWS core → Serverless patterns → Projects** —
you’ll be able to *speak your team’s language* and also actually build things.

---

If you want, I can take his **Be A Better Dev AWS path** and convert it into a **step-by-step 30-day learning plan** with exact videos + mini-projects so you don’t lose time figuring out what’s next. That way you’ll learn in the most efficient order.
