When we say **fine-tuning a large language model (LLM)**, it can mean different things depending on the level and scope of the tuning. Let’s break it down:

---

### ✅ **1. Full Fine-Tuning (all layers including attention layers):**

* **What it does:** Updates **all weights** of the model, including attention layers, feedforward layers, embeddings, etc.
* **Pros:** Maximum flexibility — the model can adapt deeply to the new data.
* **Cons:** Requires **a lot of data**, compute power, and time. Risk of overfitting or catastrophic forgetting if not done properly.

---

### ✅ **2. Partial Fine-Tuning (adapter-based / LoRA / prefix tuning):**

* **What it does:** Keeps the base model **frozen**, and trains only a **small number of additional parameters** (e.g., adapters, low-rank matrices, prefixes).
* **Popular techniques:**

  * **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**
  * **Adapter Layers**
  * **Prefix/Prompt tuning**
* **Pros:** Much more efficient, less data and compute required. Good for domain adaptation.
* **Cons:** Slightly less powerful than full fine-tuning but very effective in most use cases.

---

### ✅ **3. Head-only Fine-Tuning (like classification or Q\&A tasks):**

* **What it does:** Add a **new neural network "head"** (usually a linear layer or MLP) on top of the frozen LLM, and train **only this head**.
* **Use case:** When you're using the LLM as a feature extractor and just want to map its output to a specific task like sentiment classification, entity recognition, etc.
* **Pros:** Fast, low-resource.
* **Cons:** Doesn't modify the language understanding of the base model — only adapts outputs for the specific task.

### 🔁 Summary:

| Fine-tuning Type      | Base Model Updated? | Extra Layers? | Use Case                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Full Fine-Tuning      | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No          | Domain-specific LLM              |
| Adapter / LoRA Tuning | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (small) | Efficient domain/task adaptation |
| Head-only Fine-Tuning | ❌ No                | ✅ Yes (head)  | Classification, Q\&A, etc.       |

Great question — and yes, you're absolutely right to distinguish between **fine-tuning** and **prompt parameter tuning**. Let's clarify the difference:

---

### ✅ 1. **Fine-Tuning** a Model (weights-level change):

* **What it is:** Actually **modifying the internal weights** of the model based on training data.
* **Cost:** Expensive (compute, memory, time), and needs careful training.
* **Effect:** The model **"learns" new behavior**, patterns, or knowledge. This can be permanent and deeply integrated.
* **Example:** Training GPT-style model on legal documents to make it better at legal language.

---

### ✅ 2. **Prompt Parameter Tuning (aka decoding strategy tuning):**

* **What it is:** Tweaking the **generation settings**, like:

  * `temperature`: how random the output is.
  * `top_k`, `top_p` (nucleus sampling): control diversity.
  * `max_tokens`: limit length.
* **Cost:** **Zero training** needed. It’s just about configuring the output at runtime.
* **Effect:** Doesn’t change the model’s knowledge or structure, but affects **how responses are generated**.
* **Example:** Lowering temperature for deterministic answers in a chatbot, increasing top\_k for creativity in story generation.

### 🔁 Key Differences:

| Feature                    | Fine-Tuning                         | Prompt Parameter Tuning                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Affects model weights?     | ✅ Yes                               | ❌ No                                        |
| Requires training data?    | ✅ Yes                               | ❌ No                                        |
| Cost (compute/time)?       | 💸 High                             | 🆓 Very low                                 |
| Permanent behavior change? | ✅ Yes (new knowledge)               | ❌ No (runtime only)                         |
| Use case                   | Custom knowledge, task-specific LLM | Better phrasing, style, or response control |

So yes — **prompt parameter tuning is not fine-tuning**. It’s more like adjusting the knobs on a radio to improve the sound, versus reprogramming the radio's firmware.

Would you like an example comparing output with different `temperature` or `top_k` settings?

The statement suggests:
**Try different prompts and adjust generation parameters** (like temperature, top\_k, etc.) — **not** fine-tuning the model.

### 🔍 Keywords indicating this:

* "**Prompt engineering**" → modifying the input prompts.
* "**LLM parameter tuning**" → adjusting settings like temperature, top\_p.
* "At least 5 combinations" → experimenting with prompt + parameter variations.
* No mention of training, weights, or datasets → **not fine-tuning**.

So, it's about **getting better output from the existing model** using prompt & decoding strategies — *not* modifying the model itself.
