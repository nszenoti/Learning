If you don't explicitly pass the `region_name`, `aws_access_key_id`, or `aws_secret_access_key` to the `boto3.client()`, `boto3` will automatically look for these credentials in several places. Here's how it works:

1. **Environment variables**: If you are using `load_dotenv`, and your `.env` file contains the AWS keys and region (like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`), `boto3` will automatically load them from there. You would need to ensure that you call `load_dotenv()` before initializing the `boto3.client()`.

2. **AWS credentials file**: `boto3` also checks the `~/.aws/credentials` file for stored credentials and `~/.aws/config` for the region. You can set up these files using the AWS CLI (`aws configure`).

3. **IAM roles**: If your application is running on an AWS resource (like EC2 or Lambda), `boto3` will use the IAM role associated with that resource, provided it has the necessary permissions.

4. **Other sources**: `boto3` also checks environment variables like `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`, and can also use profiles set via `AWS_PROFILE` for credentials.

So yes, if you use `load_dotenv()` to load credentials and region settings from a `.env` file, `boto3` will use them automatically without the need to pass them explicitly when calling `boto3.client()`. Just make sure you load the environment variables before initializing the client.
