To find good embedding models on Hugging Face for your task, follow these steps:

---

### 🔍 1. **Define Your Task Clearly**
Know exactly what you want embeddings for. Common tasks include:
- **Semantic similarity** (e.g., sentence similarity)
- **Clustering** (e.g., grouping similar texts)
- **Classification** (used as features)
- **Search / Retrieval** (e.g., question-answering, RAG)

---

### 🔎 2. **Search the Right Model Type**
Use [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) with filters and keywords:

- Search terms: `embedding`, `sentence-transformers`, `text-embedding`, `retrieval`
- Filters: 
  - **Task**: Select `feature-extraction`, `sentence-similarity`, `retrieval`
  - **Library**: Choose `sentence-transformers` or `transformers`
  - **Sort**: By *downloads*, *likes*, or *most recently updated*

Example searches:
- `"text embedding sentence-transformers"`
- `"retrieval embedding transformers"`

---

### 🧪 3. **Use Leaderboards and Benchmarks**
Check out:
- [MTEB (Massive Text Embedding Benchmark)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard)
- [BEIR Benchmark](https://github.com/beir-cellar/beir)

These leaderboards show performance across different embedding tasks and domains.

---

### ✅ 4. **Evaluate Models Yourself**
Once you shortlist 2–3 models:
- Use tools like [`sentence-transformers`](https://www.sbert.net/) for quick evaluation.
- Test on a **small representative dataset** for your task.
- Metrics: cosine similarity, clustering purity, classification accuracy, retrieval score (e.g., MRR, nDCG).

---

### 💡 5. **Popular Starting Points**
Here are some widely used models:
- **`sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`** – Lightweight, good for general similarity.
- **`sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2`** – Better performance, larger.
- **`intfloat/e5-large` or `e5-base`** – Good for retrieval and QA embeddings.
- **`BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5`** – Strong in retrieval, works well with natural language queries.
- **`microsoft/mpnet-base`** – Versatile for general embeddings.
