In Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, the term **"max tokens – 4K"** means that the model has a **maximum context window of 4,096 tokens** (4K = 4,096). This limit includes both:

* The **input** (your prompt, question, or conversation history), and
* The **output** (the model's response).

### 🔹 What is a "token"?

A **token** is not exactly a word or a character — it's a chunk of text. For English:

* Common words like “cat” or “walk” are usually 1 token.
* Punctuation marks are tokens too (e.g., `.` or `!`).
* Long or rare words can be split into multiple tokens.

**Examples**:

| Text                     | # Tokens |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| `Hello`                  | 1        |
| `I love pizza.`          | 4        |
| `Internationalization`   | 3        |
| `The quick brown fox...` | 6        |

### 🔹 Max Tokens: 4K Example

Let’s say you’re using a 4K-token model like GPT-3.5-turbo (4K version). Here's how it works:

```plaintext
Prompt: "Explain the theory of relativity in detail." (7 tokens)
Response: Let's say it's 4090 tokens long.
Total: 7 (input) + 4090 (output) = 4097 → ❌ Too much!
```

So the model will **either**:

* Truncate your prompt,
* Or stop the response early to keep the total within 4,096 tokens.

---

### 🔹 Why it matters

If your input is **too long**, the model has less room to respond. For example:

* If your input = 3,000 tokens → Only \~1,096 tokens left for output.
* If your input = 4,000 tokens → Only \~96 tokens left for output.
