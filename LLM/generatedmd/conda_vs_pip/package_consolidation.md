what if I install via pip 
it wont be listed under conda list
but whilst working in .py file
we will have access to accumulated packages from conda and pip right

---

Exactly! Here's a more detailed explanation of how that works:

### 1. **Installation via Pip in a Conda Environment**

When you install packages using **`pip`** inside a **Conda environment**, they will **not appear in `conda list`** because `pip` manages its own environment, separate from Conda's management. However, the important thing to understand is that **Pip-installed packages will still be available in the environment**, just like **Conda-installed packages**, as long as you're working within the same environment.

### 2. **How the Python Environment Works with Conda and Pip**

When you're working in your Python project, **whether you install a package using `pip` or `conda`**, as long as you’re working within a specific **Conda environment**, **Python will have access to both**.

This is because **Python packages** (whether installed by `pip` or `conda`) get installed into the **same environment's site-packages directory**, which is a shared location for all packages used by the Python interpreter.

### 3. **What Happens Under the Hood:**

* **Conda Environment**: Conda manages the **environment** and provides isolation. All dependencies (Python and non-Python) installed via **`conda`** or **`pip`** are installed into this environment.
* **Pip-installed packages**: Even though they won't appear in the `conda list`, they will still be installed into the **Python environment** that Conda is managing. When you run your Python code in this environment, **both Conda and Pip packages** are available to you.

### 4. **Example:**

Let's say you have a Conda environment called `myenv`, and you install some packages via `conda` and some via `pip`.

1. **Install `boto3` via `conda-forge`**:

   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge boto3
   ```

2. **Install `requests` via `pip`**:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

Even though **`requests`** won't show up in the `conda list`, both **`boto3`** (installed by Conda) and **`requests`** (installed by Pip) will be available when you import them in your `.py` files, because they are both part of the same environment.

### 5. **Verifying the Installed Packages:**

* If you run `conda list`, you will only see **Conda-installed packages** (like `boto3`).
* If you run `pip list`, you will see **Pip-installed packages** (like `requests`).

### 6. **Summary**

* **`pip` and `conda` coexist**: They both work within the same environment, so you can access both **Pip-installed** and **Conda-installed packages** as long as you're in the same environment.
* **`conda list` won't show Pip packages**, but they **are available** in the environment when you use them in your Python code.

### A Few Things to Keep in Mind:

* **Use Pip and Conda within the same environment carefully**: While it's generally fine to mix `pip` and `conda`, it's important to ensure you don’t introduce conflicts (e.g., with versions of dependencies). Conda handles dependency resolution for you, but `pip` does not. If you need more control over package versions, it's best to rely on one package manager or ensure compatibility.
* **Package conflicts**: If a package is installed using both `pip` and `conda`, there might be version conflicts. In that case, it might be best to remove one and stick with the other.
