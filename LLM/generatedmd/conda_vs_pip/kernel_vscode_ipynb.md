Yes, after installing the kernel spec for your Conda environment (`llm-env`), you **should** see it as an option in the **kernel selection menu** in VS Code — *but only if a few conditions are met*:

### ✅ Checklist to make it appear in VS Code:

1. **Jupyter extension is installed** in VS Code.
2. The environment (`llm-env`) has the `ipykernel` package installed. If not, run:

   ```bash
   conda activate llm-env
   pip install ipykernel
   ```
3. You’ve already run:

   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=llm-env
   ```

   (Which you clearly have, given the `Installed kernelspec` message.)
4. **VS Code is restarted** after the installation — this is often needed for it to refresh the kernel list.

---

### How to select it in VS Code:

1. Open a `.ipynb` notebook file.
2. Click the kernel name at the top right (e.g., “Python 3”).
3. In the dropdown, look for `llm-env` and select it.

Would you like a command to uninstall this kernel spec later if needed?
