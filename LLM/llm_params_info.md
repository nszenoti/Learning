Yes — you're absolutely right.

For most practical RAG and LLM use cases, the **three most important parameters** to focus on are:

---

### ✅ **1. `max_tokens`**

* Controls **how long** the response can be.
* For RAG, a larger value is often needed to handle more detailed, multi-part answers.

---

### ✅ **2. `temperature`**

* Controls **randomness** in token selection.
* Lower (`0.2–0.5`): More focused, factual (great for RAG).
* Higher (`0.7+`): More creative or diverse (less ideal for clinical settings).

---

### ✅ **3. `top_p` (nucleus sampling)**

* Controls **probability mass** to sample from.
* Lower (`0.7–0.9`): More deterministic, focused output.
* Used instead of or alongside `top_k`.

---

Other params like `repetition_penalty`, `top_k`, or `stop` can **refine or polish** generation but are not strictly necessary unless you're customizing deeply or see repeated mistakes.
