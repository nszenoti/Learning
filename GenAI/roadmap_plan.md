Great! You're asking exactly the kind of questions that help cut through the hype and really *grok* modern AI. Let's break this down:

---

## 🔍 **1. Are All These Part of the Same Category?**

Yes and no.

### ✅ **They belong to a broader umbrella:**

**→ "Generative AI (GenAI)"**, which largely overlaps with:

* **Modern NLP**
* **Foundation Models (LLMs like GPT, Claude, Gemini)**
* **Autonomous Systems (AI Agents, Agentic AI)**
* **Tool-using LLMs (plugins, APIs, etc.)**

### ✅ Core roots are in:

* **ML/DL (base)**
* **NLP (text understanding & generation)**
* **Reinforcement Learning (used in AI agents and fine-tuning)**
* **Software Integration (for automation/tools)**

## 🧭 **3. Recommended Learning Path**

### 📘 **\[Stage 1] Prerequisites (You already started ML/DL)**

* ✅ Deep Learning basics (done)
* ✅ NLP basics (tokenization, embeddings, attention)
* ✅ Transformers (attention is all you need)
* ✅ LLMs (pretraining, fine-tuning)

---

### 📘 **\[Stage 2] Core GenAI Concepts**

**Focus:** Deep dive into how LLMs work and how they are used today.

1. **LLMs**

   * Architecture (decoder-only)
   * Pretraining vs Fine-tuning vs In-context learning
   * LoRA / PEFT / Quantization

2. **Prompt Engineering**

   * Zero-shot, few-shot
   * Chain of Thought (CoT)
   * Tool use in prompting

3. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**

   * Vector databases (FAISS, Chroma, Weaviate)
   * Embeddings (OpenAI, HuggingFace)
   * Context injection

4. **Function Calling / Tool Use**

   * OpenAI Tool use, LangChain tools, Agent tools

---

### 📘 **\[Stage 3] Agents & Agentic AI**

**Focus:** AI that can plan and execute like a "worker."

1. **Agent Frameworks**

   * LangChain Agents
   * CrewAI
   * Autogen (Microsoft)
   * LangGraph (stateful agents)

2. **Agentic Patterns**

   * Planner-Executor loop
   * Memory (Short-term + Long-term)
   * Tool use and Orchestration

---

### 📘 **\[Stage 4] AI + Automation Platforms**

**Focus:** Real-world automation using GenAI.

1. **n8n / Zapier / Workflow automation**

   * AI + Task orchestration
   * Calling APIs / Webhooks / GPT-4

2. **LangChain / LlamaIndex**

   * Knowledge Apps (chat over PDFs, websites)
   * Document loaders
   * Graph + Index-based apps

---

### 📘 **\[Stage 5] Productionizing**

* Vector DBs (Qdrant, Pinecone)
* LLMOps (weights & biases, MLflow)
* APIs and UI (FastAPI + Streamlit/NextJS)
* Open-source models (Mistral, LLaMA, etc.)

If you want, I can turn this into a Trello board or Notion plan with topics, tutorials, projects, etc. Would that help?
